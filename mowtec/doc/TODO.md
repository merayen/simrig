# TODO MowTec
- [ ] Simple testing with Rust:
	- [ ] Configurate GPIO 17 (pin 11) as output
	- [ ] Find voltage out (configurable?)
	- [ ] Find highest frequency
- Wait for Micro HDMI-cable, then:
	- If we can use the LCD display with only power and HDMI:
		- [ ] Create interface to the GPIO-sockets by soldering board directly on to the Raspberry Pi 4B
- [ ] Select output function on GPIO: (GPIO No., RPi 4B No.)
	- [ ] 17, 11, green 0
	- [ ] 27, 13, green 1
	- [ ] 22, 15, green 2
	- [ ] 23, 16, green 3
	- [ ] 24, 18, yellow 0
	- [ ] 25, 22, yellow 1
	- [ ] 5,  29, yellow 2
	- [ ] 6,  31, red 0
	- [ ] 16, 36, red 1
	- [ ] 26, 37, red 2
- [ ] Find correct resistor values and transistors for LEDs
	- [ ] Find small bipolar transistors
- [ ] Make Project Cars 2 shared memory to UDP data-sender
	- [ ] Need to be developed for Windows. Rust? C++ and CLion?
